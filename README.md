# Fabulous Event Finder

- **Description**

  - The Fabulous Event Finder is a React application that pulls a current list of events from the TicketMaster Events API by search criteria.
  - This application avoids the caching of TicketMaster data on their servers in order to feed you more relevant ad material, and also increasing ticket prices after viewing on their site.

  - (v1 mvp complete) As a user, I would like to purchase tickets from the event search so that I can complete everything in one process.
  - (v1 mvp complete) As a user, I would like to know the event details before purchasing tickets, so that I can decide if I want to attend.
  - (v2) As a user, I would also like to search in a specific radius from my choice, so that I can see events near me as well.
  - (v2) As a user, I would like to narrow my search results by event type, so that I don't have to see sports.
  - (v2) As a user, I would also like to narrow my search results by sub-type, so that I can get more specific results returned.
